# Model Training and Checkpointing

This document describes how to train Sentimentizer models (RNN, Encoder, Decoder, or ModernBERT), manage training checkpoints, and leverage distributed training with Ray Train.

## Prerequisites

Before starting training, you must download the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings and obtain the Yelp reviews dataset.

```bash
# Downloads GloVe embeddings and prints Yelp dataset instructions
make download-data
```

`scripts/download_data.sh` fetches GloVe automatically. The Yelp dataset cannot
be downloaded programmatically — the script prints the manual steps: register at
<https://www.yelp.com/dataset>, download the archive, and place it at
`static/yelp_dataset.tar`.

## Single-Node Training

To run the pipeline on a single node, you can use the `sentimentizer` CLI.

### Pipeline Stage Isolation

The pipeline is split into three main stages (extract -> tokenize -> train). You can run the entire pipeline at once, or run stages independently.

```bash
# Run the entire pipeline: extract -> tokenize -> train
sentimentizer run --save

# Extract stage only (outputs static/reviews.parquet)
sentimentizer extract --stop 10000

# Tokenization stage only (outputs static/dictionary.txt and static/dataset.parquet)
sentimentizer tokenize

# Train stage only (requires existing parquet/dictionary artifacts)
sentimentizer train --save
```

### Global Options

The CLI supports global options that must be provided **before** the subcommand:

- `--model [rnn|encoder|decoder|modernbert]`: Model type to train (default: `rnn`).
- `--device [auto|cuda|mps|cpu]`: Device to use (default: `auto`).
- `--run-type [new|update]`: controls fresh-build vs reuse. `new` (default) creates new pipeline artifacts. `update` reuses existing ones.

*Example:*
```bash
sentimentizer --model encoder --device cuda train --save
```

### Sleep Prevention (Linux only)

To prevent your system from suspending or sleeping during long-running training epochs, the Makefile targets automatically wrap execution using `systemd-inhibit` (if available on the host OS):

```bash
systemd-inhibit --what=sleep --who='training' --why='Model training in progress' --mode=block
```

If `systemd-inhibit` is not found, it falls back to direct execution. You can disable this behavior manually by running:

```bash
make train INHIBIT_SLEEP=
```

---

## Distributed Training

Sentimentizer supports multi-GPU/multi-node distributed training using Ray Train.

```bash
# Run distributed training with 2 Ray Train workers
sentimentizer train --distributed --num-workers 2 --save
```

Under the hood, Ray Train orchestrates PyTorch `DistributedDataParallel` (DDP) across the workers. Prometheus metrics are collected from worker rank 0 and published to the metrics endpoints.

## Checkpointing

Model checkpointing is enabled by default during training to protect against system crashes, preemptions, or accidental interruptions.

### Checkpoint Structure

Checkpoints are saved inside the `checkpoints/<model_type>/` directory:
- `checkpoint_epoch_<epoch>.pth`: Periodic checkpoint saved at the end of each epoch (frequency controlled by `--checkpoint-every`).
- `best_model.pth`: Saved whenever the validation loss improves (controlled by `--checkpoint-best`, which defaults to True).

A checkpoint file contains a dictionary of:
- `model_state_dict`: Model weights.
- `optimizer_state_dict`: Optimizer states.
- `scheduler_state_dict`: Learning rate scheduler states.
- `epoch`: The epoch number at which the checkpoint was saved.
- `val_loss`: Validation loss for tracking the best model.
- `config`: Hyperparameters and configuration.

### CLI Checkpoint Controls

- **Save Checkpoint Every N Epochs**: `--checkpoint-every N` (default: 1)
- **Disable Checkpoints / Saving**: `--no-save` (disables all checkpoint saving and weight persistence)
- **Resume Training**: `--resume` (or `--resume-train` inside `sentimentizer run`) resumes training from the latest checkpoint found in the checkpoint directory.

*Example (Resuming training):*
```bash
sentimentizer train --resume --save
```
